# Hide Folders And Files

`Hide Folders and Files` allows you to hide and unhide folders or files globally or in your workspace using a simple shortcut.

To hide folder or file, right-click a folder or file and select `Hide Folder` or `Hide File`.

Reminder: Hiding folders or files using glob patterns may affect the behavior of other extensions or tools that rely on the file structure. Before hiding a folder or file, consider whether doing so may cause unintended side effects.

Note: `Everywhere` always has higher priority than `Workspace`.

To unhide folder or file, right click anywhere in the explorer and select `Unhide Folder Or File`.

`Unhide Folder Or File` will open the workspace settings for you to remove the hidden folder or file glob pattern if you want to unhide a previously hidden folder or file. This will allow the folder or file to be displayed in the Explorer view again.
